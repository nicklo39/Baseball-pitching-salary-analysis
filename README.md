# Baseball-pitching-salary-analysis

Is there a true recipe into how to make a championship team? 
This is a brief look into spending strategies of MLB  pitchers and their teams. 

There is much controversy as to what consistitutes a good pitcher. Some might say "most strike outs," others might say "lowest ERA," while this analysis prioritizes innings pitched as the important factor. 

Stats and salaries were mined from MLB.com and spotrac.com.

The three teams highlighted here are teams that had 2+ pitchers that pitched more than 200 innings last season (the Texas Rangers and coincidentally, the two World Series combatants, Houston Astros and Washington Nationals). 

200+ innings was an arbitrary milestone selected for this analysis.
